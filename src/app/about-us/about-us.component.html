<p>Entrepreneurship has caught up with individuals like never before. The millennials have simply intensified this startup fever, to say the least. The entrepreneurial ecosystem continues to evolve into something bigger, something so prominent that one could not have imagined a phenomenon of this magnitude even a decade back. To keep pace with this burgeoning field, people need a community, a platform that constantly revamps itself with the latest happenings and trends in the world of startups. This is where StartupTalky comes to the rescue. StartupTalky is among India's leading platforms for founders and other stakeholders on the entrepreneurial boat to share their invaluable knowledge, skill, and experiences.
    Launching and running a startup (read successfully) is a herculean task. Hundreds of ventures and initiatives are launched every day but only a tiny number actually make it through the struggle. This pain point was a major reason behind the idea of launching StartupTalky. We envisioned a community for and of innovators and inventors where people could openly discuss their problems and queries to get them solved with inputs and opinions of a large, knowledgeable crowd.
    With this blog, we are on a mission to create an online repository of resources and guides for people curious to launch and run startups/self-initiatives/freelancing careers. Here, you can find articles and posts spread across a wide continuumâ€”from idea generation and funding to exiting from your startup. The blog isn't restricted to startup and funding stories; there are umpteen articles on the successes, failures, and learnings of men and women who dared to think beyond a 9 to 5 job.</p>
